We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

I live my life on the run
I say I'm not giving up
I may be living alone
But I still believe in love

In a similar way I feel I'm
Losing my conscience
Traveling for days without my
Knowledge of provenance

Throughout my life you've called me a renegade, oh
Through all my lows you said we could start again
But I'm a renegade of your love
Oh, oh, but I'm a renegade of your love

But I'm a renegade of your...

Throughout my life you called me a renegade
A renegade
A renegade
A renegade

A renegade
A renegade
A renegade
A renegade of your love

Been on the streets a few months
I'm trying to pick myself up
I may be living alone
But I still believe in love

And although my flaws had
Dragged me down on the coldest night
I'm still kickin' around and I saw you
Back before my time was shortened, oh

Throughout my life you've called me a renegade, oh
Through all my lows you said we could start again
But I'm a renegade of your love, ohh
But I'm a renegade of your love

But I'm a renegade of your...

But I'm a renegade of your love...

Throughout my life you've called me a renegade
A renegade
A renegade
A renegade

A renegade
A renegade
A renegade
A renegade of your love

You can put your arms around
Arms around, arms around
What's already gone
It might be too late to say
Sorry, hey, let me stay
Yeah, I was wrong

For everything you've done, done, done
You wish you'd better run, run, run
It might be too late to say
Sorry, hey, let me stay
Yeah, I was wrong
When love's already gone

You can put your arms around
Arms around, arms around
What's already gone

You wish you'd better run, run, run
It might be too late to say
Sorry, hey, let me stay
Yeah, I was wrong
When love's already gone
When love's already gone

Even if you close your eyes
Trust your lies
Realise it's already gone
Now it is too late to cry
Wave goodbye
Don't ask why
No turn around

For everything you've done, done, done
You wish you'd better run, run, run
It might be too late to say
Sorry, hey, let me stay
Yeah, I was wrong
When love's already gone

You can put your arms around
Arms around, arms around
What's already gone
